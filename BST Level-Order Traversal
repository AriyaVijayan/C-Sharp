Task
A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, , pointing to the root of a binary search tree. 
Complete the levelOrder function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.


	static void levelOrder(Node root){
  		//Write your code here
          Queue Q = new Queue();
        Q.Enqueue(root);

        while (Q.Count > 0) {
            Node curNode = (Node) Q.Peek();
            if (curNode.left != null) {
                Q.Enqueue(curNode.left);
            }
            if (curNode.right != null) {
                Q.Enqueue(curNode.right);
            }
            Console.Write(curNode.data + " ");
            Q.Dequeue();
        }
    }
